This is my another project of Data Analysis BlackFriday Sale.
Prerequiste Libraries: 
1. Pandas
2. Seaborn

The Dataset9csv) file is being provided out there with columns:
User_ID	,Product_ID,	Gender,	Age, Occupation,	City_Category,	Stay_In_Current_City_Years,	Marital_Status,	Product_Category_1,	Product_Category_2,	Product_Category_3,	Purchase.

During the Data CLeaning process we found alot of null values in the Product_Category_2 and	Product_Category_3 columns ,so we removed this columns to ensure data size but we can impute these I don't havr the knowledge of that using ML.

In the Juypter Notebooks I have Analysied Columns individually first then by the taking 2 or more Columns and Written my insights below the visuals.

That's it for now,see you next time.
